# Runtime dependencies for the MIDI Masterator project
# tkinter ships with the standard library on Windows.
# Core dependency:
mido>=1.2,<2.0

# Optional (uncomment to enable real MIDI hardware I/O backend):
# python-rtmidi>=1.5,<2.0
# Installing python-rtmidi from source on Windows requires MSVC Build Tools.
# If wheels are unavailable for your Python version, either install the
# "Desktop development with C++" workload (VS Build Tools) or use Python 3.11.
