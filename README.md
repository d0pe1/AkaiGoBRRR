## What is AkaiGoBRRR?

AkaiGoBRRR is the ultimate hack for your Akai MIDI controller. Tired of your controller acting like a toddler on a sugar rush every time you change banks? Sick of losing your carefully dialed-in values because Akai thought “pickup mode” was too much fun for their users? AkaiGoBRRR fixes all that—and then some.

## Features

### 🚀 Smart Pickup Mode
No more value jumps when switching banks! Our custom pickup mode is so smart, it could probably run for president. It uses push-pull scaling, so when you get close to your saved value, it smoothly snaps the output to your input—no matter which way you turn the knob. Akai could’ve done this, but they were too busy counting their money.

### 🎚️ Self-Scaling Pickup
Move within 25 units of your saved value, and AkaiGoBRRR starts gently pulling or pushing the output. Over the next 35 units, it locks in your value like a pro. You get precision, control, and zero drama. Akai? They gave you chaos.

### 🏦 Bank Management That Doesn’t Suck
Switch banks without your values going haywire. Your settings stay put, your workflow stays smooth, and your controller finally feels like it’s worth more than a Happy Meal toy.

### 🦾 Customizable MIDI Handling
Plug in your Akai, and AkaiGoBRRR takes over. Custom scripts, smart state handling, and solo MIDI management. You want control? You got it.

### 🖥️ GUI for Humans
No cryptic menus. No “read the manual” moments. Just a clean, simple interface that lets you master your MIDI like Akai never wanted you to.

### 🧠 State Memory
Remembers your last settings, so you don’t have to. AkaiGoBRRR is like your controller’s brain—if Akai had bothered to give it one.

### 🔥 JSON Bank Files
Save, load, and swap banks with JSON files. Because you deserve modern convenience, not 1990s firmware.

### 🛠️ Extensible & Hackable
Want to add your own features? Go wild. AkaiGoBRRR is open, documented, and ready for your weirdest ideas.
